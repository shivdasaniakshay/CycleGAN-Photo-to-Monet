# CycleGAN-Photo-to-Monet

This project was built off the Kaggle competition called "I'm something of a painter myself," and uses that dataet. 
You'll notice that the final code trains the model but does not finish displsying it. 
That's because it takes too long for my computer to run, which is normal for CycleGAN but inconvenient for me. 
For best use, run for around 100 epochs.
